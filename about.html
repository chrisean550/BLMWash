				<p>Black Lives Matter Washington is a member-led organization that was formed in light of the cruel murder of George Floyd. Every year black lives are unjustifiably lost by law enforcement because of racial prejudices. However, police brutality is just a single issue of systematic racism and oppression. Systematic racism has been embedded in every aspect of our society. For too long we have seen people face racial discrimination in the courtroom, the education system, the healthcare system, the environment, finding a job, and more. We are working to be involved in the black community and restructure our system to provide equal rights and opportunities for minorities.</p>
				<p>We organized Black Lives Matter Washington to serve and support black and brown men, women, and LGBTQIA+ members who are confronted daily with the damage that the ongoing history of oppression has caused. We are guided by the fact that all Black lives matter, regardless of actual or perceived sexual identity, gender identity, gender expression, economic status, ability, disability, religious beliefs or disbeliefs, immigration status, or location. We are unapologetically Black in our positioning. In affirming that Black Lives Matter, we need not qualify our position. To love and desire freedom and justice for ourselves is a prerequisite for wanting the same for others.</p>
				<p>With the implementation of our committees, we intend on confronting each aspect of systematic racism. By spreading our values and educating others on how white supremacy/ fragility, systematic racism, and the history of oppression continues to hurt black people. By getting involved in government to encourage passing bills that combat racism and ensure that candidates are held accountable for issues that impact black and under-served communities. By demanding that our educational system includes black history into their curriculum and provides equal support and encouragement to our black students.</p>
				<p>Barack Obama once said “Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change we seek.” You can be that change by reaching out and getting involved with our organization.</p>
